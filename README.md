# Cypress with BDD (Cucumber pre-processor)

 #### MODEL/DESIGN
 Cypress design with BDD using Gherkin syntax (Given, When, Then), with Cucumber.

 #### STRENGTH:
 - BDD is a great way to write tests that are easy to read and to get non-technical people involved in the testing process.
 - BDD is quite strong at ensuring your tests are in line with your business logic.

 #### CHALLENGE:
 - BDD tests are not as flexible as other types of tests, and they can be difficult to maintain.
 - Due to the complexity of setting up scenarios and the number of steps involved, tests don't necessarily cover all the edge cases and you might end up with a lot of scenarios to cover all of them.
